# Teleporter - Transport for the Modern Ages

This project is for my CodeInstitute Full Stack Dev course. Specifically this is the final module milestone project in "Full Stack Frameworks with Django".

The purpose of this application is to track bug and features for my Teleporter service.

Bugs can be reported for free but feature request votes incur a cost; this is how the service is funded.
